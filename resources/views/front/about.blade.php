My team and I set out to merge my passion for story telling, their creative technical abilities and our experience in managing brand communities into a cost-effective service that can be transformed to fit each brandâ€™s 
                        unique needs. Having ran a startup business myself, I understand that emerging brands and the people that run them are strapped for time and resources. My goal was to help each brand bridge the gap between the need for additional resources and the cost that goes into creating a social media marketing department. Through our combined efforts, my team and I aim to help business owners outsource time-consuming tasks so they can get back to focusing on scaling their brands. </p>
